## Instructions

1. In a tall, frosty glass, combine the watermelon balls and crushed ice.

2. Pour over the coconut water, allowing the subtle sweetness to infuse.

3. Add a generous splash of pineapple juice for a tropical twist.

4. Grate a touch of lime zest over the top for a zesty kick.

5. Stir gently to mix the flavors.

6. Garnish with a sprig of mint, adding a refreshing aroma.

Presentation: Served on a bamboo tray, accompanied by a slender straw and a tiny umbrella, this drink is a vibrant blend of flavors and colors. The ruby red of the watermelon contrasts beautifully with the green mint and the pale straw hue of the coconut water, making it not only a delight to sip but also a feast for the eyes.

This drink would be perfect for sipping while lounging on a beach, the sound of waves in the background and the warmth of the sun above. Enjoy your virtual tropical escape!
