## Ingredients

- 2 batches flax eggs - or egg substitute of your choice
- 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
- 2 heaping Tbsp Meyer lemon zest (or regular lemons)
- 1/3 cup Meyer lemon juice (or regular lemon juice)
- 1 tsp vanilla or lemon extract (optional)
- 1/4 cup maple syrup or agave nectar (sub honey if not vegan)
- 1/3 cup natural cane sugar
- 1/2 tsp sea salt
- 1 Tbsp poppy seeds (optional // or sub chia seeds)
- 1 cup whole-wheat pastry flour (or sub unbleached all-purpose)
- 1/2 cup rolled oats
- 1/2 cup almond meal

## For the Glaze: 

- 1 cup powdered sugar (sifted)
- 1 Tbsp lemon juice

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C)** and line a standard muffin tin with 12 paper liners, or lightly grease.

2. **Prepare flax eggs in a large mixing bowl** and let rest for a few minutes. Zest lemon(s) at this time.

3. **Add applesauce, lemon zest, lemon juice, vanilla or lemon extract (optional), oil, almond milk, maple syrup or agave, cane sugar, baking soda, salt and whisk.** It will foam up because the lemon juice will react with the baking soda.

4. **Add flour, almond meal and oats and stir with a spoon or spatula until just combined, being careful not to over-mix1.**

5. **Bake** The Vegan Lemon Poppy Seed Muffins should be baked in a preheated oven at 375 degrees F (190 C) for about 20 minutes.
